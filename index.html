						<h1 style="color: green">Happy Father's Day!</h1>
						<p>Daddy, </p>							
						<p>Both you and mommy each play equally important parts in the role as our parents. You will always be the first person we go to for advice. From academics to activities, you have provided us with endless insight that we value greatly. </p>
						<p>This past year has emphasized a theme you always remind us of: it isnâ€™t always the outcome that matters, but the journey it takes to get there. </p>							
						<p>Alex and I both started new chapters in our lives, the beginning of college and the start of high school, respectively. With this fresh page brings new experiences that we are ready to embrace, after all life is essentially a collection of experiences that shape who we are. We are both really excited to begin this next chapter in our lives and will continue soliciting your wisdom and guidance. </p>						
						<p>We love you so much.</p>						
						<p>Your two little munchkins, <br>Alex and Anna<br><span class="date">June 2021</span></p>
